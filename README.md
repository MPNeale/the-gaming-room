-Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The gaming room is a client who has a currently running Android app for a game called Draw It or Lose It. They wish to create a web based version of the game capable of running on multiple operating platforms.
  
-What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I enjoyed learning about the development requirements of different operating systems. I was not very familiar with Mac and less so with Linux, so it was nice to learn a bit more about those systems.
  
-What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Design documents are helpful to layout the design of a program. The document outlines what is expected of the program, such as how it should work and what it is supposed to do. Knowing what is expected of the code is important to avoid problems in the future from having to make unexpected changes.
  
-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  In this case the user needs to be familiar with the concept of a game, be able to use a computer, and understand how to work a web browser. The user is the one who will be using your program, so it is important to consider their needs. If users are unable to or do not want to use your program, then it is not a good program.
  
-How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  In designing software, it is best to begin with a software design document including a UML diagram. Outlining what the software is intended to do and how it should be done is an important first step. In the future I will use a software design document to pre-plan designing a program.
